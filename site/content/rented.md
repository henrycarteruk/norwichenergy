Rented Properties
=================

 Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) are now law
-------------------------------------------------------

As a local energy assessor and landlord, I know there are a proportion of properties being rented that will be affected and we've known about these regulations becoming law for a few years now.

The six most important things landlords need to know are:

1. From **April 2016** tenants have been able to request a landlord make improvements to a property and, if this can be delivered at no up-front cost to the landlord, then the landlord cannot "unreasonably refuse". Schemes like Green Deal have been financing certain energy improvements in the past, but a replacement for this is awaited.
2. From **April 2018** a landlord cannot grant a new tenancy of a property with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating below an E (a score of 38 or less).
3. Failure to comply could lead to **penalties** totaling up to **Â£5000**.
4. From **April 2020** a landlord cannot rent any property with an EPC rating below an E.
5. The government has declared their intention to **raise the standards further**, such that the minimum is likely to rise to a D Rating by 2025 and a C in 2030.
6. What to do next if you have a property with a rating of low E, F or G...

    * Don't panic! The good news is you don't have to pay for improvements, although it may be wise to do so in the longer term (see number 5 above).
    * You will however have to jump through some hoops in order to get an exemption for F or G rated properties.
    * Another issue might raise its head here; local authorities will be responsible for enforcement and, as a guess, this may force them to set up a register of landlords and properties.2

The regulations
---------------

The regulations suggest that tenants should always explore informal alternatives directly with their landlord before using the more formal procedures in the Act. There are also various terms like tenants' improvements, superior landlords duties, tribunal action, relevant improvements, exemptions, compliance notice.

However, the government has not yet published guidelines on how the system will operate, so diving into detail will be easier once this has happened (ELA will let you know). You can look up the full regulationss in the Act if you wish via www.gov.uk, or see the information on the RLA website for more detail. Here's what you could be doing in the meantime...

The practical bit
-----------------

Properties most likely to be affected probably have a solid brick gable wall; any type of electric or LPG heating; little or no loft insulation; single glazing. So, landlords could be doing as follows:

* Find the EPC for any property with low E, F or G energy rating (if you don't have a copy, they are all available on www.epcregister.com).
* If the EPC is only a few points below an E, look at the recommended improvement measures to see if there is a quick fix e.g. put in more loft insulation or upgrade the boiler if it is an old one anyway. The recommendations section will tell you how many points will be added to the rating for each improvement.
* Contact the person (stated on the EPC) who carried out the assessment and ask them to re-run the data to see what the new rating would be for any improvement you might carry out, or have carried out since the EPC was done.
    * If the assessor says "*What's MEES? I don't know what you are talking about*" then consider contacting another assessor who does know what they are doing!
    * It might be best anyway to get a new EPC if the existing one was done before April 2012. An EPC can be left in draft form until improvements have been carried out, so you don't have to pay for yet another one if you carry out improvements.
