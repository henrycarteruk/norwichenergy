About EPC's
=============

Here's what happens...
----------------------

**Simply put**, the energy assessor visits your property to collect the relevant details and then creates the EPC.

* Assessment of the property includes the size, construction and location of the house and relevant information about fittings (e.g. heating systems, hot water, lighting) levels of insulation, fuels used, etc. This short survey normally takes 30-45 minutes.

The EPC tells you about the energy efficiency of the property and gives appropriate recommendations on how it could be improved.

* The property is given an energy rating from A to G and a similar rating for the environmental impact, in terms of carbon (CO2) emissions. An example of a rating chart is shown below. The ratings are based on standard assumptions about fuel costs, occupancy and heating levels in order to make it possible for buyers to compare different properties. Sellers are at liberty to show prospective buyers the actual fuel bills.

Since most sellers are buyers as well, it is a good idea for everyone to know what's in an EPC. That's why Tony Carter will always offer to show you an [example of an EPC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/49997/1790388.pdf) and explain what's in it when he arrives to do the survey.

Do I need an EPC?
=================

All properties sold or let must have an EPC - even a private sale to a family member or friend. You will probably fine that either your estate agent or solicitor will inform you of this requirement. From October 1st 2008, home-owners were made responsible for the Energy Performance Certificate. So check your estate agent doesn't trip-up and potentially land you both with a Â£200 fine!

Can I market my home without an EPC?
------------------------------------

**Yes**, but you must get one as soon as possible.

* The regulations say that you or your estate agent must have already ordered an Energy Performance Certificate before marketing commences i.e. a Domestic Energy Assessor must have been instructed to prepare an EPC for your property before it goes on the market.
* There must be a 'reasonable' expectation that the EPC will be made available within 7 days of the property first appearing on the market - i.e. when it is 'advertised' to the public or prospective buyers are contacted.
* If the EPC is not available, both the seller and the agent responsible for marketing your home, must make all reasonable efforts to obtain it as soon as possible.

What happens to the EPC?
------------------------

The EPC must be made available:

* when the property is viewed, if available
* when written information is provided on request, if available
* certainly before contracts are exchanged.
* anyone has a right to ask to see the full EPC

Beware of unscrupulous 'professionals' telling you that the EPC has to be renewed every time the property goes on the market - it has happened! All EPC's are available to the public on [www.epcregister.com](http://www.epcregister.com). Select the Domestic Register then click on 'search using property address' and follow the instructions.

How long is an EPC valid for?
-----------------------------

An EPC is valid for **10 Years** so remember to keep a copy in case you don't sell your home at the moment.

EPC Exemptions
--------------

Some types of property are exempt from having an EPC when sold. Here are the categories:

* Properties subject to a condition limiting their use to occupation for less than 11 months per year or holiday accommodation[^1]
* Mixed sales (eg. shop with flat)
* Non residential property
* Right to buy and similar properties
* Sales of property portfolios
* Properties not sold with complete vacant possession
* Unsafe properties and properties to be demolished
* Park homes
* Listed historic buildings

**FOR YOUR SAFETY**

All Domestic Energy Assessors have been checked by the Criminal Records Bureau and the quality of their work is monitored by an official Accreditation Scheme. Also, we will always make an appointment and should carry an identity card.

Please do not allow unexpected, cold callers into your home to carry out an energy assessment.

[^1]: Taking effect from 30 June 2011, new guidance from DCLG states that an EPC must be obtained for properties that are rented out as holiday lets for 4 months or more in any 12 month period. Holiday lets are defined as a roofed construction having walls for which energy is used to condition the indoor environment. This definition excludes caravans, tents, mobile homes etc
