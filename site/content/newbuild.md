New Build Properties
=======================

From 1st May 2008, new-build homes marketed for sale must have an EPC produced by the SAP method and called an 'on-construction EPC', produced by a SAP Assessor.

New homes, marketed off-plan (before they are built), will have had SAP* calculations done to show how they comply with the Building Regulations. Then, before a Building Control completion certificate can be issued, a full Energy Performance Certificate must be obtained by the person responsible for the construction.

This type of EPC must also be done by a qualified SAP Assessor and will probably be the person who carried out the calculations for the design.
