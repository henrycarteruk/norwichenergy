Our ethical policies
====================

At Norwich Energy we have an ethical approach to business - everything is transparent, we support the local economy and we care about environmental issues. We will always keep you well informed and we aim to provide an efficient and reliable service to help you at all times.

No hidden fees
--------------

* We are transparent in our business dealings.
* If you are entitled to a free service we will let you know.
* If we receive a commission for any product or service we recommend, we will tell you.
* No inducements or favours accepted.

Our green commitment - reducing the impact on the environment
-------------------------------------------------------------

* We use recyclable materials and products from sustainable sources wherever possible.
* We have a fuel-efficient diesel car but endeavour to minimise journeys whenever possible. A car is necessary for our work because we have to carry equipment around to provide you with the best service.

No fat cats
-----------

* We are a local business with no overpaid directors or remote shareholders.

Supporting the local economy
----------------------------

* This is important to us - we trade with other local businesses where possible and find they are more reliable and give better value for money.

Social responsibility
---------------------

* We have experience of working with community groups and will be happy to talk to your residents association, parish meeting etc to see how we could work together.

Thank you for visiting our website. I have been interested in ethical business for a long time and am delighted to see that it is now becoming mainstream.

I hope you find our approach is a refreshing change - do get in touch so we can discuss the best way we can help you.
